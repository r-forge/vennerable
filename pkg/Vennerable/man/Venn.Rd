\title{Construct intersections of sets}
\description{
Given a collection of Sets, \code{Venn} will compute all possible 
combinations of intersections and return an object of class \code{Venn}, storing the combinations as well
as the number of elements in each intersection (the 'weights'). 
It will also accept a specification of the weights directly,
or simply of the number of sets desired.
}
\usage{
Venn(Sets, Weight, SetNames, numberOfSets)
Weights(object)
Weights(object) <- value
}
\arguments{
  \item{Sets}{A list, each element of which can be a list defining the members of a Set}
  \item{Weight}{A named vector of weights to associate with each possible combination of Set intersections.
	Ignored if \code{Sets} is present.}
  \item{SetNames}{A character vector of names for each Set. Ignored if \code{Sets} present and has names}
  \item{numberOfSets}{An integer for the number of Sets. Ignored if  \code{Sets} or \code{SetNames} present.}
  \item{object}{An object of class \code{Venn}}
  \item{value}{An object like \code{Weight}}
}
\value{An object of class \code{Venn}}
